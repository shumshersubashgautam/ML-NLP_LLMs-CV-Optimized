The name itself gives us several clues to what BERT is all about.\n","\n","BERT architecture consists of several Transformer encoders stacked together. Each Transformer encoder encapsulates two sub-layers: a self-attention layer and a feed-forward layer.\n","\n","### There are two different BERT models:\n","\n","- BERT base, which is a BERT model consists of 12 layers of Transformer encoder, 12 attention heads, 768 hidden size, and 110M parameters.\n","\n","- BERT large, which is a BERT model consists of 24 layers of Transformer encoder,16 attention heads, 1024 hidden size, and 340 parameters.\n","\n","\n","\n","BERT Input and Output\n","BERT model expects a sequence of tokens (words) as an input. In each sequence of tokens, there are two special tokens that BERT would expect as an input:\n","\n","- [CLS]: This is the first token of every sequence, which stands for classification token.\n","- [SEP]: This is the token that makes BERT know which token belongs to which sequence. This special token is mainly important for a next sentence prediction task or question-answering task. If we only have one sequence, then this token will be appended to the end of the sequence.\n","\n","\n","It is also important to note that the maximum size of tokens that can be fed into BERT model is 512. If the tokens in a sequence are less than 512, we can use padding to fill the unused token slots with [PAD] token. If the tokens in a sequence are longer than 512, then we need to do a truncation.\n","\n","And thatâ€™s all that BERT expects as input.\n","\n","BERT model then will output an embedding vector of size 768 in each of the tokens. We can use these vectors as an input for different kinds of NLP applications, whether it is text classification, next sentence prediction, Named-Entity-Recognition (NER), or question-answering.\n","\n","\n","------------\n","\n","**For a text classification task**, we focus our attention on the embedding vector output from the special [CLS] token. This means that weâ€™re going to use the embedding vector of size 768 from [CLS] token as an input for our classifier, which then will output a vector of size the number of classes in our classification task.\n","\n","-----------------------\n","\n","![Imgur](https://imgur.com/NpeB9vb.png)\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# The concept of adding a custom task-specific layer to a HF Model\n","\n","![](1.png)\n","\n","\n","When we switch from the pretraining task to the downstream task, we\n","need to replace the last layer of the model with one that is suitable for the task.\n","This last layer is called the model head; itâ€™s the part that is task-specific. \n","\n","The rest of the model is called the body; it includes the token embeddings and\n","transformer layers that are task-agnostic. \n","\n","This structure is reflected in the Transformers code as well: the body of a model is implemented in a class such\n","as BertModel or GPT2Model that returns the hidden states of the last layer. \n","\n","### To get it we do `outputs[0]=last hidden state`\n","\n","The hidden states are passed as inputs to a model head to produce the final output. ðŸ¤— Transformers provides a different model head for each task as long as a model supports the task (i.e., you canâ€™t use DistilBERT for a sequence-to-sequence task like translation).\n","\n","And then we have Task-specific models such as BertForMaskedLM or BertForSequenceClassification - which usees the base model and add the necessary head on top of the hidden states,\n","\n","For example, **`DistilBertForSequenceClassification`** is a base DistilBERT model with a sequence classification head. The sequence classification head is a linear layer on top of the **pooled** outputs.\n","\n","For a **question answering task**, you would use the **`DistilBertForQuestionAnswering`** model head.
