### Here's an example to illustrate the difference between additive and multiplicative seasonality:

Suppose you have a time series representing the daily revenue of an online store. The revenue data exhibits a strong yearly seasonality, with higher sales during the holiday season. As the store grows, the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuations also increases.

If you use an additive model, the seasonal effect would be constant across years, which might not accurately capture the increasing seasonal fluctuations. In contrast, a multiplicative model allows the seasonal effect to scale with the trend, better capturing the increasing fluctuations as the store's revenue grows.
