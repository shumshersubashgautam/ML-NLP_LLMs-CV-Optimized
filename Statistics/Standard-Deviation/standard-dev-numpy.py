The NumPy function np.std takes an optional parameter ddof: "Delta Degrees of Freedom". By default, this is 0. Set it to 1 to get the result for Sampling Standard Deviation:

if we select a random sample of N elements from a larger distribution and calculate the variance, division by N can lead to an underestimate of the actual variance. To fix this, we can lower the number we divide by (the degrees of freedom) to a number less than N (usually N-1). The ddof parameter allows us change the divisor by the amount we specify.

So a simplistic rule of thumb is:

Include ddof=1 if you're calculating np.std() for a sample taken from your full dataset.

And else

If you are calculating on the full dataset and NOT a sample of it, then use ddof=0 i

The DDOF is included for samples in order to counterbalance bias that can occur in the numbers.
